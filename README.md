# High Precision Sentiment Analysis with Recommendation

## Overview

Our project is a comprehensive effort to provide high-precision sentiment analysis with recommendations across various data sources. It is divided into four primary components, encompassing image-based, speech-based, text-based, and social media analysis, with a special focus on both WhatsApp and Twitter data.

## Text-Based Sentiment Analysis

The text-based sentiment analysis model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to process natural language, offering multi-class sentiment classification. It ensures accuracy in sentiment prediction and is equipped with visualization capabilities for performance monitoring.

## Speech Model

The speech model focuses on speech emotion recognition, utilizing audio data and LSTM. Feature extraction and modeling tools like Librosa are used, and the TESS Toronto dataset provides diverse emotional speech samples for understanding and classifying emotions in speech data.

## Image and Video-Based Analysis

For image and video-based analysis, we have harnessed the power of DeepFace, a pre-trained model comprising VGG Face and OpenCV. It matches emotions and generates appropriate images for test inputs, enabling precise emotional content retrieval.

## Social Media Analysis

Our social media analysis component tackles both WhatsApp and Twitter data. WhatsApp chat analysis involves data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing, resulting in detailed insights on chat content, word cloud generation, and sentiment analysis. Similarly, the Twitter analysis model adeptly handles complex tweets, utilizing the Hugging Face model pre-trained on extensive Twitter data for accurate sentiment predictions.

## User Engagement and Recommendations

To enhance user engagement and collect data effectively, we've implemented ReactJS as the front-end tool, complemented by Firebase for backend data storage. This ensures seamless user data retrieval and facilitates tailored recommendations based on individual preferences.

## Future Development

Our ambition is to seamlessly integrate these models into a user-friendly website and app, making daily sentiment analysis accessible to everyone. We are also developing a recommendation system that intelligently tracks users' day-to-day activities, offering motivation during happy moments, calming techniques during anger, and light-hearted content during sad periods. This holistic approach not only enhances user experiences but also contributes to mental well-being.

## Project Vision

In summary, our project not only offers high-precision sentiment analysis but also envisions a future where these insights are seamlessly integrated into daily life. Through user-friendly interfaces and intelligent recommendations, our project aims to make a meaningful impact on how individuals perceive, understand, and respond to their emotions, fostering positive mental health and overall well-being.
